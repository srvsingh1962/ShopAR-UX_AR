# ShopAR - UX_AR ([Video](https://youtu.be/cJV9hC-p42M))

Worked on building the prototype of the case study :Improving the Amazon Augmented Reality mobile shopping experience (https://www.mukulagarwal.com/work/amazon). As UX Plays the most important role for any AR experience and it can be said UX is the heart of a great AR experience.

☝️ The major problem in concern was:
1. Customers place the 3D model on their feet, resulting in confusion as to the 3D model fully blocks the camera view. ( Solved by setting up min and max distance of the 3D model from the user)
2. Customers don’t understand that the 3D model is on the floor and thus do not trust the scale of the 3D model. ( Solved by using the 3D cursor on the bottom of the model )

✌️Feature added to the experience:
1. Giving information about the 3D model to the user that it is in FOV.
2. As the 3D cursor will be oblique to the camera for a larger distance and will not be visible to the customer so added the wave/folding effect to the cursor.
3. Pinch scale and twist rotate on the 3D model.
